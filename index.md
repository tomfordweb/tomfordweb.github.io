Tom Ford is a full stack developer with over ten years experience creating websites and web based applications.

Main languages are in PHP, JavaScript and Python. I find myself mostly in working with the web, containers, linux, and continious integration systems lately.

Besides writing code, I enjoy my racecars. I have built, blueprinted and calibrated two turbocharged Subaru engines, one of which is now around 500 horsepower, the other my daily driver.

In additon to cars, I have been working on setting up a homelab for faster pipelines and a better developer experience.

Always looking to <a href="mailto:tomfordweb@gmail.com">work with other developers</a>.
